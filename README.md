## Description
Application of React with Next.js to build a small scale clone of Airbnb for learning and practice purposes:
Technologies used: React.js (Next.js) front, Sanity.io (CMS) backend, Google Maps API.

- Sanity.io was used for building schemas of properties, hosts, travellers. Once the schemas were built, content could be added on to the CMS in the backend.
- Next.js used in the frontend over React, for enhanced server-side rendering opposed to client-side rendering. In addition, static routing is built in Next.js, pages can be built dynamically.

## Future Improvements
- Google maps API still return inaccurate position, which requires fixing.
- Setup account and login features, for host to create listings and travellers to book properties and write reviews.
- Enhance the UI/UX experience.
